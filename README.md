Virtual Library project: [Carlos](https://github.com/Carltesio) and [Philip](https://github.com/pgaunizt)

The code - 

This program serves a digital catalogue between a library and a customer.

- The 'digital library' allows user and library to check the books by its title or         Author.
- The 'digital library' allows user and library to check a list of the available and       unavailable books.
- The 'digital library' allos the library to change the availability status of a book.
- The 'digital library' allow the user and library to see when a book will be available    again.

Dependencies - 

This project uses Bundle to manage the Gemfiles and YAML for the data.
The code consists in two folders, 'lib' and 'spec':
Lib - Stores the implmentation code in the file 'library, and the data 'data.yml'.
Spec - Contains the test for the implementation code in the 'library_spec.rb'.

The Virtual Library has been developed and stored Github. Carltesio/github.com and pgaunizt/github.com have forked the repository from craftacademy/github.com.
Every part of the worked has been commited into Github and the parts of code that were created but were not used in the final code have been left at the bottom of the file 'library.rb' as comments.

How to setup the code and run it:

-Install Ruby
-Install Bundler: https://bundler.io
-instructions: the program can be used through IRB (test on it are still to be made)

The code was implemented following inputs from the Craft Academy learning material and  solutions of our own.

Credits: The part of the code that changes the status of the availability was developed           with suggestions from robin-lillqvist/github.com

License: The follwing code is open source as part of a learning process type of project. Feel free to implement and/or suggest any modifications to it.

Project requirements
"We need an app where both the visitors and the library can see if a list of books is available, it would be nice to see both the title and the author of the book. The library needs to store these books in a file where we can easily check if a book is available or not. The library also needs the visitors to check out books after finding the title they want. Depending on the time of the checkout the library needs the books to be returned within a month and obviously, it would be nice for the visitor to know which date to return the book."

## Library Challenge
### Week 1 Ruby challenge

Instructions
-------
Read this entire README carefully and follow all instructions.

* Challenge time: this weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, your notes, previously written code, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to or have in whole or partially used the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution to GitHub and create a Pull Request**
* You must submit a Pull Request to this repository with your code by 9.30am Monday morning - before the stand-up


### Tasks
----

* Fork the challenge repo: https://github.com/CraftAcademy/library-challenge
* Run the command `bundle install` in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write your specs and implementation
* Be smart about using Git: commit and push often. Use feature branches.
* Create a Pull Request as soon as possible
* Read the comments from Hound and fix any issues that the service points out.

### Tips
----

##### Some hints:
  * A Person needs to have a list of books that he currently has in his possession. That list needs to include the return date.
  * The return date can be calculated using the `Date` object. Out of the box, there are methods you can use to add days to the current date.
  * Make use of `doubles` when writing your specs
  * Follow the [naming conventions/standards](https://craftacademy.gitbooks.io/coding-as-a-craft/content/extras/naming_standards.html) for methods and variables

### What we are looking for
----
##### I'm hoping to see that:
* You can take a problem set and write a well tested implementation on your own.
* You understand how to define Ruby Classes and work with objects.
* You understand how classes can interact with each other.
* You know how to make use of arrays, hashes, and associated methods to create dynamic lists.
* You know how to write specs and use them as a blueprint in your development.
* I can track your work by following you commit history - so please commit as soon you are done with a feature or when you have made a test pass.

##### In your Pull Request, I'm hoping to see:
* That you are testing the right thing in the right spec file.
* That all tests passing - green is good!
* High test coverage (above 95% is accepted)
* The code is easy to follow: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short, code is nicely formatted, etc.
* The `README.md` includes information on how to use your solution with command examples in `irb`. (Feel free to remove this text)


**Happy coding!**
